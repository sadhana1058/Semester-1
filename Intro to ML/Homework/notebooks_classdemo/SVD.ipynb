Cleverly, you've kept track of what users buy, so you have a complete picture of the site's shopping status. Great!, but how useful is this data? You really want to target customers with products they might have a genuine interest in without it being classed as \"spam\". The system you require is usually called a __Recommender System__ and should be an integral part of the marketing process in your business. \n",

This naturally forms a matrix with the amounts bought as elements and with missing values as the values we mainly wish to predict. Missing values are potential selling points, so we can target users with these products either through direct mail or product placement when they view the website. It also gives some indication of the amount of stock that might be required for each item.
