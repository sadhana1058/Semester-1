# Algorithm Design and Analysis Course

## Course Description
This course introduces the design and analysis of algorithms, a fundamental aspect of computer science. Throughout the course, we will explore fundamental algorithm concepts, covering a range of topics including:

- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms**

In addition, we will apply these techniques to solve significant problems, such as:

- Scheduling
- Caching
- Sorting
- The Knapsack Problem
- Matrix Multiplication
- Shortest Path Algorithms
- Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

Furthermore, the course will address the limitations of algorithms, with a focus on concepts like:

- **NP-Completeness Theory**
- **Approximation Algorithms**

By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of these essential algorithms and their applications, as well as an appreciation for the theoretical insights that guide algorithmic design and analysis.
